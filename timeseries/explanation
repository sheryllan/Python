First let's assume the two time series are non-stationary and of I(1). 
# For simplicity, the test for integration(unit root test) is neglected here, because a cusory preprocessing of the data with plot exhibits a clear trend and strong correlation between the two time seires.

I'd like to do the cointegration test between the two time series, which is finding a linear combination between them that yields a I(0) process with stationary residual eplison


The question is divided into 2 parts:
	1. Time series behaviour hypothesis and feature analysis
	2. Anomaly detection, model validation and hypothesis verification 

1.1 Data preprocessing 
The module 'preprocessin.py' is dedicated to this purpose. It is used by the other scripts for loading and preprocessing of the data.
The steps are:
	- clean up the invalid data 
	- plot sample data for cusory observation
	- normalize the data 
A preliminary view from the plot identifies the two time series are:
	- trending
	- moving in the same direction(correlated)
	- have some scaling offset
	- exch series 

1.2 Hypotheses and assumptions
According to the features observed, it is reasonable to make assuption that the two TS are non-stationary and of I(1).
